# Calculator-Project

This is a basic calculator project i made using python. It allows the user to hold simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplicationa and division.
The program runs in the terminal and asks the user to enter two numbers and choose the operation they want to perform.
It also checks for invalid inputs like dividing by zero. 
This project helped me understand functions, loops, user input, and error handling in python.It's a simple program but was useful for practising basic programming logic.
